  - Tests processor class loading for Python agents
  - Creates ZIP package with all necessary files
  - Includes dependency files (pyproject.toml, package.json, requirements.txt)

### Documentation Updates ✅
- [x] Update the README.md on how to use this to create a sample agent for both python and nodejs
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Implementation**: Completely rewrote README.md with comprehensive examples
- **Features**:
  - Step-by-step Python agent creation guide
  - Step-by-step Node.js agent creation guide
  - Build command usage instructions
  - Configuration requirements documentation
